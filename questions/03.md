## Correct

`LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`

> the right table.

## Incorrect

`RIGHT JOIN`

> This is a valid SQL join type, but it's not supported by SQLite, and it's much
> less common than `INNER` and `LEFT` joins.

## Incorrect

> This is a valid SQL join type, but it's not supported by SQLite, and it's much
> less common than `INNER` and `LEFT` joins.

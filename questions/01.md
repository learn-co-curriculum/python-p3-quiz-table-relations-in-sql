# Question

We have two tables: `users` and `posts`. A user has many posts, and a post
belongs to a user. How should we relate the two tables to one another?

## Correct

Put a `user_id` foreign key on the `posts` table pointing to the `id` primary
key in the `users` table.

> Yes! We can store which user a post belongs to by having each post point to a
> user.

## Incorrect

Put a `post_id` foreign key on the `users` table pointing to the `id` primary
key in the `posts` table.

> Not quite. This would allow a user to have only one post.

## Incorrect

Create a join table that points to both `users` and `posts`

> We can actually relate the users and posts without a join table. How can we do
> that?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.

# Question

Our database has two tables: `cocktails` and `restaurants`. The same cocktail
can be served by many restaurants, and each restaurant serves many different
cocktails. How can we relate cocktails to restaurants?

## Correct

Create a join table where each row relates a cocktail with a restaurant

> Perfect! This is a many-to-many relationship, so we need a join table that has
> cocktail\_id and restaurant\_id columns.

## Incorrect

Add a `cocktail_id` column (foreign key) to the `restaurants` table

> Not quite. This would allow restaurants to serve only a single cocktail. A
> restaurant would belong to a cocktail.

## Incorrect

Add a `restaurant_id` column (foreign key) to the `cocktails` table

> Not quite. This would mean each cocktail could be served at only one restaurant.
> A cocktail would belong to a restaurant.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.

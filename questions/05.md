# SQL: Joins

We have two tables: `dogs` and `owners`. All of the owners have dogs, but not
all dogs belong to an owner â€” some are strays. Which query will return ALL of
the dogs and their matching owners?

## Correct

```sql
SELECT * FROM dogs
LEFT JOIN owners ON dogs.owner_id = owners.id;
```

> Correct! `dogs` is the left table, so all of the dogs will be returned, even if
> they don't have an owner. Matching owners will also be returned.

## Incorrect

```sql
SELECT * FROM owners
LEFT JOIN dogs ON dogs.owner_id = owners.id;
```

> Not quite. This will actually return all of the owners and their matching dogs.
> Which query will give us every dog?

## Incorrect

```sql
SELECT * FROM dogs
INNER JOIN owners ON dogs.owner_id = owners.id;
```

> Not quite. This will actually only return dogs that have an owner. Which query
> will give us every dog?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
